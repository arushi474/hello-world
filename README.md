# hello-world
This is my first repository.
Hello People,
I am Arushi Anand, currently pursuing B.Tech in Mining Engineering.
I'm in my second year of graduation. Although my branch of study is 
mining but I'm quite inclined towards learning Software Development 
and about Opensource softwares.
This is my first repository and me exploring Github for the first time.
I'm quite excited as I type this. Looking forward for a great learning 
experience through Github.
